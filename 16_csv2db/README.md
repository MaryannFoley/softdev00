Your (duo) MISSION: Read data from CSV files, and create a database whose table structure mimics that of the CSV files.

(In the care package you will find a CSV file of students and their IDs, and another linking said IDs to the students' current grades in some courses. If you desire more lulz, you may wish to use CSVs representing your small business employee info.)

TASK the Foist: Familiarize yourself with Python's CSV module, specifically its DictReader() method, as it will greatly expedite your work going forward. (If you are already familiar, do your crew a solid and share protips/insights on the QAF.)

TASK the Second: Read through the db_builder skeleton, and talk it over with your ducky and co-driver BEFORE you begin making it your ownâ€¦

TASK the Toid: Flesh out skeletal db_builder.py, which will

    create a new SQLite database
    utilize csv.DictReader() to read each provided CSV file
    create a table for each
    populate each table
