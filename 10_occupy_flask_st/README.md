# K #10: Jinja Tuning ...

For this you will refer to your prior occupation assignment. You are encouraged to re-use and refactor code as necessary.

Your (duo) job:

Write a Flask app with an "/occupations" route, which will generate an HTML page with an appropriate title, a descriptive heading, and a table-ified version of the occupations data, along with a a randomly selected occupation shown at the top.

    Simplicity is divine.
    Note anything notable.
    Use QAF liberally.
    Store this in a directory named 10_occupy_flask_st in your workshop repo.

If you're feeling flasky, and you've completed the requirements above, try this on for size:

    For each occupation, find a link that would be helpful to get started in that field.
    Add that link to the occupations.csv file.
    Include the link in the python dictionary you create
    (Note: you'll have to store the percentage and the link as values attached to each name)
    When Your flask app renders the page, include the link to help your users on their way to their new job.
